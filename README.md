## About

### General Information
  - This is our project created by our team to complete our Algorithms & Data Structures Course <br>
  - Game name : Flappy Bird <br>
  - Category: Arcade <br>
  - About: Just a bird fly accross Tubes <br>
  
### Rules
  - Use the space button to fly the bird, try to use all your concentration and care to keep the bird alive because the bird is very fragile and weak, if it hits the tube or the ground, the bird will go to see the ancestor right away. <br>
